我们首先来看下载量。这两个饼图是基于不同价格区间应用的总下载量制作的。首先来看这个小的，我们可以明显看到免费应用平均下载量的巨大优势。这意味着大多数用户下载免费应用。实际上我们将minor part夸大了，付费部分几乎不可见。

Hello. Now I'll share my analysis of price.

I'll analyze installations and rating as well.

First let's look at the total amount of installation. Look at this pie chart, the area denotes amount, so you can see a preponderance of free apps. That means most users download them. 

Then let's look at the minor part--paid apps. To be more specific, let me enlarge it.

Look at this big one. We divide paid apps into some ranges like this.（用鼠标指）This is the range and the percentage is the proportion of installation.

我们把价格分为这几个区间：xxxxx。我们可以看到，小于5美元的应用几乎占了总下载量的四分之三。

The point is, these bright color parts are apps less than $5. Their total installations account for nearly 3 quarters.

结论：人们更愿意下载便宜的应用。所以为了获得尽量多的下载量，我们要尽量让应用的价格在较低水平。我们可以通过内置广告或引入额外收费服务to share the cost。

So we can conclude that people prefer cheaper apps. For app companies, if you want greater popularity, you'd better control the price. To share the cost, you can insert ads or optional charge into your apps.

接下来我们看一些关于rating的有趣的东西。

这是不同价格区间的rating分布

Next, let's see something interesting about rating.

This bar chart is about the distribution of rating in different price ranges.

This is free group and these are paid groups(指). In each group you can see the maximum, minimum and average of rating. And darker color means more installations.

Then you can see the paid apps with more installations, with darker color here. Their ratings are generally above 4. However, not all popular apps in free group receive high rating.

That's to say, users are probably more particular about an app if it's paid. So paid apps may depend more on their quality.  And those popular ones must have unique recipes for us to learn from.
