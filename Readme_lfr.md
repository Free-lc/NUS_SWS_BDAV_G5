# Data Analysis:

-  The main question: The Top-quality apps in different genres

  o  How to define The Top quality :We consider that the Overall user rating of the apps is of the most significant，and the downloads and the number of comments are also important to rank the apps, which reflect the number of users and the user activity on App.

  So, We decide to use the rating and the number of installs to measure the measure the quality of Apps. But there are also some dimensions of the apps in the dataset we need to analysis whether we should add them to the Rank formula, such as the Size of the Apps, the Price of the Apps. In order to design the formula to rank Apps we post 4 sub questions.

  o  How the size of Apps effects the applications' Rating

  The bar chart demonstrates that the size of app has no direct correlation with downloads. But, we can find a interesting condition that the size between 14k and 16k and the size between 76k and 80k have large downloads. 

  According to my data analysis, the rating of app increases as the size of app gets bigger. In other words, the bigger Apps may have the higher rating. So, if we have decided to add rating to measure the quality of the Apps, we need not to add the size of App to the ranking formula, Where the size of the apps has great correlation with the rating of the applications.
