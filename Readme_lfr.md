## 2021/7/19/15:47 analyise the relationship between the size of App and the rating

# Data Analysis:

-  The main question: The Top-quality apps in different genres

  o  How to define The Top quality :We consider that the Overall user rating of the apps is of the most significant，and the downloads and the number of comments are also important to rank the apps, which reflect the number of users and the user activity on App.

  So, We decide to use the rating and the number of installs to measure the measure the quality of Apps. But there are also some dimensions of the apps in the dataset we need to analysis whether we should add them to the Rank formula, such as the Size of the Apps, the Price of the Apps. In order to design the formula to rank Apps we post 4 sub questions.

  o  How the size of Apps effects the applications' Rating

  The bar chart demonstrates that the size of app has no direct correlation with downloads. But, we can find a interesting condition that the size between 14k and 16k and the size between 76k and 80k have large downloads. 

  According to my data analysis, the rating of app increases as the size of app gets bigger. In other words, the bigger Apps may have the higher rating. So, if we have decided to add rating to measure the quality of the Apps, we need not to add the size of App to the ranking formula, Where the size of the apps has great correlation with the rating of the applications.

## presentation：

- In order to make the applications be liked and popular among people, I’d like to analyze whether the size of application contributes to the popularity of an app and what size applicati-ons people like. My analysis will especially focus on the relationship between installations and the size, as well as between rating and size. Because the installations and rating of an app always reflect its popularity and people’s preference. 
   Initially, in this scatter diagram, I use red points to represent the relationship between app size and installations. And I use the green stars represent the relationship between size and rating. ( The ordinate on the left represents the average rating of apps and the right one represents the average installations in a certain size range. And the abscissa represents the size range of app in positive order.) By the green and red linear trend lines, we can conclude that the bigger applications would receive higher rating and more installations.
   Furthermore, in order to analyze the rating difference and installation difference of different app size more intuitively, I divide the apps into three groups. The apps less than 10M (megabytes) are in the LightSize group and the apps larger than 50M are in the LargeSize group, while others are in the MiddleSize group. 
   The arc chart demonstrate that the larger apps receive higher rating. Besides, we can see the larger apps acquire more installations in this bar chart. 
   In conclusion, the larger apps seem to get great popularity and favorable comment. Consequently, you app developers add as many great features and ideas as possible to you application, regardless of the size of the it. And the large excellent app will become a surprise hit.
